# Zwad System App
The Zwad System App is a multi-tech solution I built for Zwad Foundation to automate weight tracking for aid packages. It uses Arduino for sensors, Python for data conversion, C# for storage, and Figma for UI. It reflects my skills in embedded systems, programming, design, and ethical tech.
