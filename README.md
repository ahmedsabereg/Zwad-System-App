# Zwad System App

This desktop application helps foundation employees record donation data from customers. It stores entries in a structured Excel sheet for easy tracking and reporting.

Files created:
• Donations.xlsx – Excel version of the donation records
• C#_table.csv – Raw data export for internal use

All files are saved in the “_internal” folder located in the same directory as the app.
